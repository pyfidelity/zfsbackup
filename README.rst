This is a fork of the ``zfsbackup`` ZFS backup script available at
http://mij.oltrelinux.com/devel/zfsbackup/.  Please refer there to learn
more...

The package is currently not available on PyPI (as I don't want to make
a release on behalf of the original author), but you can still use `pip`
to install it like so::

  $ pip install git+git://github.com/pyfidelity/zfsbackup.git
